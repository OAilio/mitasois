# Mitäsöis - Food Management App🍕
Mitäsöis is a web app that provides the answer to the age old question "What should I eat?". It allows the user to keep track of the foods they've cooked at home (or eaten elsewhere, why not). When it's time to go grocery shopping, the user can check on the app for some foods they haven't had in a while. And if the decision proves to be tricky, the virtual kitchen staff will help with the choice! 🧑‍🍳 

*Ps. Mitäsöis is Finnish and roughly translates to "What to eat?"* 😉

## Idea 💡
In my household, most of the time we are rotating the same foods that we make ourselves. Often when we're creating a list for grocery shopping, deciding on what to make for dinner proved to be rather tricky. That's when I came up with the idea of tracking the date of when a food is last made. As a CS student this was great opportunity to fill my portfolio and solve a real life problem at the same time.  

## Technology 🔧
This application is built using the MERN stack, with the following technologies:
* **Frontend:** Developed with Vite and React, styled using SCSS.
* **Backend:** A Node.js server with Express and Mongoose.
* **Database:** MongoDB is used for data storage.

## Features 🚀
Key features of the app include:
* Track foods and their cooking dates.
* Add and edit foods with ease.
* Search by food name or filter the list of foods by protein, carb or date made.
* Receive a randomized recommendation, if the decision on what to make is tricky.
